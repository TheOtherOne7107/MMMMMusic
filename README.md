# MMMMMusic
A discord bot made to be able to download music with a YouTube link and play it through a discord voice chat.
Don't ask me how it works, I have no idea, I wrote this bot at 1 AM.
Run main.py with administrator privilages, any videos downloaded will be placed in the Videos folder
Whoever sends the !play command must be in a voice chat when sent.
## -----Commands-----
- !help #Displays commands
- !play <Link> #Downloads the Youtube video, Joins users current VC, plays YouTube video.
- !list #Lists currently downloaded videos
- !reload #Reloads the list
